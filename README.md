**Frontend**: NextJS | **Backend**: NestJS e MySQL (MongoDB e Redis são usados pelo Hsuite) - validation, Smart Node + Hedera integrations, APIs and websockets

**Project Rationale**
Inovar.Tech, a System Provider, working closely with the Compressed Air industry by providing software solutions for Industrial Technical Assistance, frequently encounters a significant problem of information disconnection and wastage. This issue encompasses technical aspects and the maturity levels of organizations handling the data generated daily.

While there is much discussion about IoT solutions for industrial machine maintenance, promising abundant data for analysis, the reality for most companies – including end clients, manufacturers, and maintenance firms – remains distant. Moreover, the data types produced extend beyond machine telemetry collected by certain systems.

The data generated by each participant in this ecosystem (Manufacturers, Technical Assistance, Clients, and technology suppliers) forms a substantial and diverse volume throughout the entire chain and life cycle of these assets. The absence of structured data exchange among these participants hampers efficient maintenance processes, ongoing product enhancements, and asset value preservation. For assets with high resale value, there are implications on investment recovery capabilities.

Concurrently, efforts to enhance information flow throughout the chain have been initiated to facilitate responsible disposal of these materials at the end of their life cycles.

An initial potential opportunity, before commencing the MVP, involves introducing a new financing mechanism for asset acquisition and fair investor compensation.

**The Proposed Resolution**

Typically, data accumulated over time and across various stakeholders in the chain is confined within silos, impeding or preventing its exchange among involved parties. As a result, leveraging this valuable data becomes impractical or excessively costly.

Numerous factors contribute to why this data is isolated in silos:

* Privacy concerns
* Security implementations
* Absence of standards
* Irregular or absent data collection

The proposed solution aims to facilitate data flow throughout the chain while upholding essential requirements and enabling structured data reuse and sharing.

The foundation of this proposal revolves around digitizing these assets by creating a digital twin (token) on a secure, rapid, cost-effective, and scalable public network (DLT). Data produced by each participant in this chain will be securely stored on a DLT to maintain integrity, security, privacy, traceability, and longevity. Each participant, besides generating data, will also be a data consumer through a complex web of private keys.

Beyond technical considerations, the process will necessitate the development of standards and methodologies to ensure seamless data flow and prevent data isolation in silos.

# How to run - Backend
#### **Build and Formatting**

* `npm run build`: Compiles the TypeScript source code into JavaScript, creating a production-ready build.
* `npm run format`: Automatically formats all TypeScript files in the `src` and `test` directories using **Prettier**.

---

#### **Application Startup**

Use these commands to start the application in different environments. The application will restart automatically whenever you make changes to a file.

* `npm run start`: Starts the application in the default environment.
* `npm run start:local`: Starts the application in the **local** environment.
* `npm run start:develop`: Starts the application in the **development** environment.
* `npm run start:stage`: Starts the application in the **staging** environment.
* `npm run start:main`: Starts the application in the **production** environment.

---

#### **Testing**

* `npm run test`: Runs the **Jest** test suite once.
* `npm run test:watch`: Runs **Jest** in watch mode, rerunning tests when files change.
* `npm run test:cov`: Runs **Jest** and generates a test coverage report.
* `npm run test:debug`: Starts **Jest** in debug mode, allowing you to attach a debugger.
* `npm run test:e2e`: Runs end-to-end (e2e) tests using the specified Jest configuration.
